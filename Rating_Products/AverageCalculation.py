df['Rating'].mean()

"""

When an average calculation is made directly in this way, 
then we may miss the recent trend for the relevant product 
or service in terms of customers. So we're missing the satisfaction trend.
For example: 
There may be a very high level of satisfaction in the first 3 months, 
but there may also be some problems with this product in the last three months of a year. 
Therefore, the positive or negative trends that may arise in relation to the presentation 
or handling of the product will lose their effect.
  
-- Instead of just averaging points, what else can be done?
-- What can we do to better reflect the current trend on the average?
